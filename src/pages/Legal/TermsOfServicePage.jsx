              <p className="text-text-secondary">By using a RoadReady vehicle, you agree you're a licensed driver, you'll obey traffic laws, and you won't try to teach the car to fly. We tried. It doesn't work, and the paperwork is a nightmare. You're renting the car, not adopting it. Please bring it back.</p>

              <p className="text-text-secondary">Our cars are for terrestrial adventures only. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: entering a demolition derby, challenging a train to a race, using the car as a submarine, or attempting to parallel park on Mars. Also, no transporting anything that would make a sniffer dog faint.</p>

              <p className="text-text-secondary">You are encouraged to sing your heart out while driving. However, by accepting these terms, you agree that RoadReady is not responsible for any sudden downpours of rain caused by your off-key rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody." Drive-thru attendants are not official judges of your talent.</p>

We are not a storage unit for rogue poultry. Any items left behind will be considered a donation to the car's personal collection of oddities.</p>
